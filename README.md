# Pseudo-CNN-network
This project implements a pseudo Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with various modes to perform different operations such as printing weights, calculating weighted sums, applying the ReLU function, softmax, and finding maximum values. The project is written in C and consists of several functions organized in different modes.
